# markusjx.github.io
 Currently, this repo only exists for the markusjx.github.io domain to exist, so I can verify to Google that I totally own this domain (and more important its subdomains e.g. [markusjx.github.io/autobet](https://markusjx.github.io/autobet/)) and of course pay for it, like any other GitHub user does for his domain.
